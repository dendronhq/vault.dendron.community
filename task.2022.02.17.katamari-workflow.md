## Summary

We currently have a documented workflow of the [[Amoeba|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.guides.workflows.amoeba]] pattern, but not of the Katamari pattern. Katamari is the Amoeba pattern in reverse: lots of micro notes that, overtime, make more sense to combine together into larger notes.

## Details

## Example

## Tasks

- [ ] Decide whether to document this workflow in `dendron-site`, or if it makes more sense in the Open PKM Catalogue (since it is tool agnostic)
- [ ] Submit a PR to the appropriate repository with the basic gist of the workflow
