## Raw
"Outlining and primarily mobile support. My ideal notetaker would be something like Obsidian, but with an outliner editor (see https://discord.com/channels/717965437182410783/735365126227493004/962784022973517864 for what's important for outlining - it's not zoom) and some Dendron-esque tooling for namespacing.

I'm not a software developer by trade (though yes by education) and don't especially need an IDE for notetaking."
