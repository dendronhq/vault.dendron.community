## Summary

We want to kickoff the Greenhouse Talks once again! To do so, we'll need our first speaker of 2022. We'll also want to review [[Greenhouse Talks|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/community.events.greenhouse]] and [[Greenhouse Talk Template|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/templates.greenhouse-talk]] for any updates needed in rebooting these events.

## Details

- Update docs
- Find interested speaker (Dendrologist might be a good first speaker?)
- Schedule event
  - Add to Luma event calendar
  - Add to Discord events
  - Leading up to the talk, use social media to spread the word
