## Announce
Heads up that the next Dendrologist meeting will be next Tuesday at 7PM UTC. 
It will be held in the newly created #env-talk channel in Discord.

As part of the meeting, I've created the following google doc for notes: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-YLQONZPqsOMh09yAJI6MdATtznWLKB-OtnoN14e3A4/edit
Gives as a place to take notes as well as leave notes ahead of time (this is how we do planning at dendron), see [[Before Meeting|dendron://dendron.handbook/templates.weekly-planning.user#before-meeting]]
