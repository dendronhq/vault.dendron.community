# Welcome to the Dendron Community Vault

To help with coordination (and because it feels wrong to coordinate on dendron without using Dendron), I've created a dedicated workspace for Dendrologist activities. 
You can clone it here: git@github.com:dendronhq/ws.dendron.community.git

This will also give you an idea of what its like to work collaboratively in Dendron. We'll be following the exact same process that we do internally in the team.

When you open the workspace with Dendron, it will pull down the following vaults:

- dendron.community (what will become the dendron community site and where we will coordinate on SOPs and initiatives)
- dendron.dendron-site: https://wiki.dendron.so/
- dendron.docs: https://docs.dendron.so/
- dendron.handbook: https://handbook.dendron.so/

The workspace and all the vaults are public and we'll be coordinating on tasks here in the same way that the Dendron team does internally. 

Some action items for everyone (please üëç if you've been able to complete these items):
- [ ] clone the workspace 
- [ ] come up with a username that they would like to have internally?
    - at Dendron, we have everyone create updates in `user.{username}` hierarchy. this lets us use @{username} syntax within notes 
    - also allows us to report progress in daily journals
    - to claim a username, create a `user.{username}` hierarchy and change the title to "{Your name}"
- [ ] for items that we talked about in the focus area threads, add them to `user.{username}.backlog`
- [ ] if you have any updates for the given day, you can do so in the daily note `user.kevin.journal.{date}`
    - for now, feel free to create an empty note with "hello world" to make sure things are working
    - example: [[Priorities|dendron://dendron.community/user.kevin.journal.2022.01.24#priorities]]
- [ ] when you are done with changes, run [[Workspace Sync|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.teams#workspace-sync]] to sync it together
