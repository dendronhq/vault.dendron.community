## Good first tasks

> Happy Friday @Dev! We've had a lot of interest from folks who would like to contribute to Dendron's codebase but aren't sure where to get started. To help, we'll be picking out `good first tasks` that will help introduce you to the code while also making a noticeable contribution to an existing feature. Each of these tasks should take no longer than an hour to complete end to end. If you choose to take one on, a member of the Dendron team will help walk you through the process -- just leave a comment on the issue.
>
> Here are this week's tasks:
>
> - [#2238: Move Header Should Have Current Hierarchy Prefilled](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/2238)
