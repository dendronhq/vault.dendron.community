## Summary

How CROPs are assigned

## Details

Each week we select 3 issues for the community to vote on. These are cultivated from our backlog based on:

1. Number of upvotes.
2. New and Interesting issues.
3. Feasibility of completion (in a week)

This is publicly documented at [[dev.process.issues]].

## Steps

1. Select the 3 issues from [[dendron.tasks.crop]]
2. Send out the discord message in the #feedback channel on Wednesday using the [[CROP template|dendron://dendron.community/sop.crop-community-issue.temp]]
    - after sending the message, add the following reactions to the message 1️⃣2️⃣3️⃣4️⃣
    - create a thread for the message for people to post their suggestion for the fourth option.
3. When voting is done, move the winning CROP into the 'In Progress' column of the [[Dendron Community Issues Board|dendron://dendron.community/ref.github#dendron-community-issues-board]]
   [[Active|dendron://private/dendron.tasks.crop#active]]
