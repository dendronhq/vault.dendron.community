## New Leaf

NOTE: please make any edits in the dendron note and use gdoc pod to export

### Context

Figuring out the growth pillar for Dendron as a business

### Initiatives

- 1. Managed publishing 
  - Currently WIP
  - @jonathan: iterative change, not hockey stick thing, very crowded space

- 2. Mobile lookup
  - @jonathan: help with retention

- **3. Indexing shell history/local history and creating notes from that**
  - Browser history organization
  - Code on stack overflow, highlight it, save it to dendron
    - Stack overflow has tags, we could just use that

- 4. Organizing data in other apps (eg. apply dendron schema/refactoring to confluence, gdoc, etc)

- 5. Sync
  - monetization

- _6. Dendron API_
  - Becomes interesting when we have **3** built out
  - Be compatible with obsidian API?

- 7. Managed Code Snippets (eg. like postman but for snippets managed in Dendron)
  - Same idea here can be applied to bookmarks

- 8. Standalone app (alfred like lookup everywhere)

- 9. One click import/export from any other tool
