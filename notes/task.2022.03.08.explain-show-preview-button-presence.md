## Summary

`Dendron: Show Preview` can be better documented on when it appears, when it is absent, and that it can't be removed.

## Details

Explain in docs that the `Dendron: Show Preview` button appears only in loaded Dendron Workspaces, and can't be removed/disabled when in those workspaces.

If wanting to use `Markdown: Open Preview`, this can still be used via the command pallete, even within Dendron Workspaces.
