### Tasks

-   [ ] we do want to implement a model similar to vscode where defaults are hidden by default unless changed. its not currently prioritized but feel free to make it a crop 🙂
-   [ ] think about better method (manual/automatic) for selecting CROP candidates for voting
-   [w] go over the full list of issues and look for CROP-worthy ones
-   [x] start a log of CROPs in [[community.events.crop]]
    -   PR or push directly to wiki site?
-   [ ] #238 talks about propagating changes to the `title` property, not when renaming notes; I got confused
-   [ ] create an issue about alternative hierarchies for publishing <https://discord.com/channels/717965437182410783/752644230379470849/943922387626385408>
-   [x] 381 vs 1393 (duplicates, need to close one)
